Project: COVID death rate and World Health Statistics
Is covid death rate higher in countries where alcohol consumption is higher?

Is covid death rate higher in countries that have a high probability of death from non-communicable diseases (cancer, heart disease etc.)?

Is covid death rate higher in countries that have high tobacco consumption?

Current news and studies may answer with a general “yes” to the above questions. However, my intent is to understand the true relation between death rate and some of the world health statistics; perhaps there are surprises that go against conventional understanding.
